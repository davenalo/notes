wget URL (pretty straight forward)

wget -O "name" URL (let's you download with a chosen name)

wget -P (path)

wget -c (resume a download which was already stopped for some reason; use the same URL)

wget -i "filepath"(-i stands for input, gets a text file as an input)



WTF. There is a frontend GUI for gnome gwget
