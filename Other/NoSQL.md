"Not only"SQL

In this sense, "nosql" is a new approach to database management, and sql a language for amange querys, we "can't" compare simply nosql and sql.

We can want to use nosql for economic reasons: less time to think about the strcuture of our database (time and resources), this nosql database can be flexible in some parts of the development process.

nosql can be moded as tables, or not; the most used model is json structures (document of key - value)

1. key - value
2. document (a group of documents: collections)
3. tabular
4. graph
